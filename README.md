# Summary

* Machine learning toolkit for natural language processing.
* Originally written for [Lisbon Machine Learning Summer School](lxmls.it.pt).

# Installation
  
* Please read instructions in the Day 0 chapter of the [LxMLS guide](https://github.com/LxMLS/lxmls_guide).

* Install the toolkit in development mode (and in the local user home):
```
python setup.py develop --user
```
  * From this point on, you can use the toolkit's package by calling `import lxmls` wherever you want, and any code changes in the `lxmls` directory
   will be reflected when the package is imported/reloaded.

# Running

* Run the labs code from within the `labs` directory (because paths to the `data` directory are hardcoded).
